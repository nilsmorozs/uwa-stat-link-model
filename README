This folder contains the code for generating and testing statistical ON-OFF link models from sea trial data. It was used to generate the results for the following paper:

N. Morozs, F. Campagnaro, L. Shen, B. T. Henson, F. Mahieu, Y. Zakharov and P. D. Mitchell, "Statistical ON-OFF Link Modeling Based on Sea Trial Data," in proceedings of WUWNet'24, Sibenik, Croatia, Oct 2024.

Data files:
***********

 - 'BerlinMultimodal-06-16.mat' - The Werbellin lake experiment dataset downloaded from the ASUNA database (https://sites.google.com/marsci.haifa.ac.il/asuna/).
 
 - 'on_off_dur_model_werbellin16.mat' - The ON-OFF statistical model generated by the "gen_link_model.m" script, as explained in the paper.
 
 - 'on_off_dur_cdfs_werbellin16.csv' - the same model but in the CSV format (to enable its use with any other prgramming lagnuages); it contains six CDFs: for three link types (good, average, poor) and two link states (ON and OFF).

***************
MATLAB scripts:
***************

- 'analyse_trial_data.m' - a script to analyse the data from the Werbellin lake experiment and generate the plots from the paper.

- 'gen_link_model.m' - a script to process the ASUNA Werbellin lake dataset and generate statistical link models as described in the paper.

- 'gen_link_realisations.m' - a script  to synthesise random link realisations using the statistical model generated by the 'gen_link_model.m' script.

- 'test_on_off_dur_gen_model.m' - to test if the synthesised random link realisations follow the same CDF distributions as the statistical model generated by the 'gen_link_model.m' script.
